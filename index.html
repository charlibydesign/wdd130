        <p>Well, you know my name and my nickname, so here's a bit more about me. I'm going for a Bachelor's degree in Applied Technology. My focuses are on computer programming, databases, and web development. I actually hold an Associate of Arts in Information Technology with a focus on Web Design from University of Phoenix, as well as an Assoicate of Applied Science in Graphic Design and an Associate of Applied Science in Digital Marketing from Western Iowa Tech Community College.</p>
        <p>As far as hobbies and things I love to do go, I'm an avid reader, lover of music, and lover of movies. For reading, I usually read YA, fantasy, science fiction, and horror - Stephen King is my all-time favorite author. Musically, again, I'll listen to just about anything, but my main musical genre is anything with the word metal attached to it - Five Finger Death Punch is my favorite band. Movies are generally either Marvel or horror - my favorite Marvel movies are the Iron Man trilogy and my favorite horror series is Halloween.</p>
        <p>I have never been married and do not have any children. My current occupation is student and an Etsy shop owner - I knit and crochet hats, scarves, shawls, Christmas stockings, and other things.</p>
        <p>The thing I love most about BYU-Idaho is that I can go online. I'm not a big fan of being in the classroom, so this is perfect for me. I've been a member of the Church since 1988, although I was inactive for a very large part of my being a member.</p>
