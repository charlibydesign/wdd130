    <h3>Purpose</h3>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our audience are athletic men and women who range in age from 18 to 45 years of age. They are people who are strong swimmers and who like the water. These are people who are looking for a new challenge when it comes to sports, especially water sports. They are not finding this in their local area and are looking online to find ways to enter the world of white water rafting. They may come from all walks of life and/or financial situations, although the majority of those booking tours will be from more affluent financial situations or businesses that are intending to book trips as rewards for employees. The majority of our clients will access our website from mobile devices, although some may access our website from computers, especially businesses looking to book employee trips.</p>
